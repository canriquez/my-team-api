# my-team-api | API Documentation

## Project description

This API serves as a backend for my microverse's full-stack final project, 'My Team Builder'. This repository contains the backend portion of the mentioned project. To get access to the frontend portion, please follow [this link](https://github.com/canriquez/my-team-builder).

### Full stack application concept

This app is used by admins to review ACTIVE applicant's information and express its approval.
It will give admins the ability to browse through the different applicants, filter applicants for the applied position, and search for specific applicants' names.

The app will offer a menu with:

    - Home
    - Preferred active applicants
    - My job Posts

# Authentication and Authorization

## Authentication: Access to resources

Authentication is realized using JWT authentication generated by the API at signup and login endpoints. These tokens will be included in the JSON response.

## Authorization

Authorization is managed via the : user role (user/admin), preventing unauthorized access to application-specific endpoints and resources.

# API Documentation

This API uses `POST`,`GET`, and `PUT` requests to communicate and HTTP [response codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes) to indicate status and errors. All responses come in standard JSON. All requests must include a `content-type` of `application/json,` and the body must be valid JSON.

## Response Codes

400: Bad Request

## Environment set up requirements

To run this project, you need ruby, rails and Postgresql installed in your environment
Run the following command:

```
$ ruby -v
ruby 2.6.5p114


$ rails -v
Rails 6.0.3.3
```

- Ruby: If you don't get that result, follow this [link](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) and install Ruby in your local environment.

- Rails: Ruby: If you don't get that result, follow this [link](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html) and install Ruby on Rails in your local environment.

- To install postgreSQL 12 (used in this project), follow [this link](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/tutorial-install.html)

### Setup

- Clone this repository in your local environment
- Located on the root of repository, execute

```
bundle install
```

```
rails db:create
rails db:migrate
```

This action will install all the required dependencies.

### Ruby on Rails Database Configuration

- Your local application should be able to create development and test databases.
- For this purpose, the database configuration file contains environment variables for the DB user and password using during the `pg` server creation.
- Please configure the environment variable `MYTEAMAPI_DATABASE_PASSWORD` with the same password used during the pg server configuration.

```

config/database.yml

[...]
#
default: &default
  adapter: postgresql
  encoding: unicode
  # For details on connection pooling, see Rails configuration guide
  # https://guides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html#database-pooling
  pool: <%= ENV.fetch("RAILS_MAX_THREADS") { 5 } %>
  username: myteamapi
  password: <%= ENV['MYTEAMAPI_DATABASE_PASSWORD'] %>

development:
  <<: *default
  database: my_team_api_development
[...]

```

### Start Development Server

To start the development server run:

```
rails s

=> Booting Puma
=> Rails 6.0.3.3 application starting in development
=> Run `rails server --help` for more startup options
Puma starting in single mode...
* Version 4.3.6 (ruby 2.6.5-p114), codename: Mysterious Traveller
* Min threads: 5, max threads: 5
* Environment: development
* Listening on tcp://127.0.0.1:3000
* Listening on tcp://[::1]:3000
Use Ctrl-C to stop

```

And the API will start listening and answering Requests.

### API endpoint testing

For testing purposes, I recommend you use the application [Postman](https://www.postman.com/), so you can test endpoints and functionalities.

## Test

- This projects uses `RSpec` for testing models and controllers
- The tests set, executes 127 tests that drove the API implementation (TDD).
- To run the test run

```
$ rspec

Finished in 3.33 seconds (files took 3.13 seconds to load)
127 examples, 0 failures
```

## Built With

- Ruby (2.6.5p114)
- Ruby on Rails (6.0.3.3)
- PostgreSQL (12.4)
- RSpec
- Capybara
- FactoryBot
- Shoulda-Matchers
